# AudioDictionary *(previously audioHTML)*
## A Dictionary for the People

The project morphed into an intuitive and simple audiodictionary, with the aim of scaling it to a more personalised form.

Should we build up a more entertaining dictionary, offering a personal and scalable experience for all the people? I say we do.

For now, we will keep a short demo of the dictionary at [stefaneduard-deaconu/audioHTML](https://stefaneduard-deaconu.github.io/audioHTML/ "AudioDictionary 1.0.2") .

The sample audios are chosen for presentation purposes.
